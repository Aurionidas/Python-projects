# Python-projects

This repository is destines to showcase projects in python that I decide to embark on with the idea of creating useful things with the potential of solving real world projects.

In the process of creating this repository I will explore such things like APIs, Dashboards, Web Scraping and other topincs that I may find along the way. I hope you en joy it.

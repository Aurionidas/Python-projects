# 🐍 Python Projects

This repository is a personal space to explore and build Python-based projects focused on solving real-world problems.  
Along the way, I’ll be learning and applying concepts such as **APIs**, **Dashboards**, **Web Scraping**, and other useful topics.

The goal is not only to practice Python but also to create practical tools and learn how to integrate them into larger workflows.

I hope you enjoy the journey!

## 📦 Contents

- **🔗 Connecting to My First API**  
  Folder: `/My_First_API`  
  A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of connecting to well-known public APIs using Python’s `requests` library.

- **📊 Dash Application**  
  Folder: `/Dash_App`  
  A simple and interactive dashboard created using **Dash** and **Plotly**, exploring core components and layout design.

- **⛅ Weather Dashboard**  
  Folder: `/Weather_App`  
  A project that combines the previous two: it fetches real-time weather data via API and displays it using a Dash interface.

More projects may be added over time as I continue learning and experimenting.

## ⚙️ Requirements

These projects are built using **Jupyter Notebooks** for ease of explanation and code demonstration.  
Before running the notebooks, make sure to install the necessary Python libraries.

### 📦 Installation Instructions (Windows)

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Python environment folder (or create a virtual environment if preferred):

```bash
cd path/to/your/python/environment
```

3. Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install dash
pip install requests
pip install python-dotenv
pip install plotly
```

## 🧩 Integration Plan
One of the goals of this repository is to eventually integrate multiple small projects into a unified app or platform.
For example:

- Use an API connection to fetch live data

- Display that data using an interactive dashboard

- Automate tasks with scripts or services as needed

- This modular approach helps build both technical skills and real-world problem-solving strategies.

Thanks for visiting this repo! Feel free to explore the folders, run the notebooks, and adapt the ideas to your own learning.
